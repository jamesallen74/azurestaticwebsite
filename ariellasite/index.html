      I am Ariella and I am 9 years old and I live in northern Cincinnati, Ohio.
      I am in 3rd grade. 
      My favorite school subjects are math and art.
      I wants to be a teacher when she grows up.
      I also want to write books about cats.
      My favorite toys are LOL and Legos.
      I love to dance, sing, draw, paint, play board games, and go to the playground.
      I love my 2 cats Bella and Candy.  
      I miss my other cats Tux and Tigger who are in kitty heaven.
      I also have a pet that is from the north pole that is real.
	  Her name is snowy and she is a snowfox.  
	  I have a goofball dad.

	  Ariella, if you ever look at this page by yourself, this is Dad.  :)  I love you very much and I am so proud of you.
