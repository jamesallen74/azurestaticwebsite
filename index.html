      Ariella is 8 years old and lives in northern Cincinnati, Ohio.
      She is in 3rd grade. 
	  Her favorite school subjects are math and art.
      She wants to be a teacher when she grows up.
      She also wants to write books about unicorns.
      Her favorite toys are unicorns, LOL, and Barbie.
      She loves to dance, sing, draw, paint, play board games, and go to the playground.
      She loves her 2 cats, and misses her other cat Tux who is in kitty heaven.
	  I also have a pet that is from the north pole that is real.
	  Her name is snowy and she is a snowfox.  
	  I promise the snowfox is real.
	  I have a goofball dad.
